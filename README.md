# Hi, I'm Ndr (Flickerflash) 👋

## About Me

Self-taught, self-directed **AI Orchestration Engineer** and **pioneer** of AI prompt engineering and MCP–autonomous AI prompt engineering portfolio creation.  
I design advanced AI frameworks and governance systems under the Agent Lavender lens and Gold Star audit standard.  
My focus is on institutional-grade evaluation systems, security frameworks, and prompt optimization methodologies built through independent research and hands-on experimentation.  
Some implementation details and client- or brand-specific elements are intentionally generalized or omitted to respect confidentiality and IP boundaries.

## 🎯 Core Expertise

- **AI Prompt Engineering** – Advanced prompt design, optimization, and meta-analysis techniques *(self-taught)*  
- **NIST AI Frameworks** – AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) implementation and compliance *(self-directed study)*  
- **AI Governance** – Paul–Elder Critical Thinking, ISO 42001, and IIA AI Auditing–aligned governance structures *(independent research)*  
- **Security Systems** – CyberShield Defense Framework (CSDF) for AI security and defense *(self-developed)*  
- **Framework Architecture** – Multi-agent systems, recursive evaluation, and benchmarking methodologies *(self-taught)*
