# Hi, I'm Ndr (Flickerflash) 👋

## About Me

**Self-taught/Self-directed** Pioneer of AI Prompt Engineering & MCP-Autonomous AI Prompt Engineering Portfolio Creator

I'm a self-directed learner specializing in designing advanced AI frameworks and governance systems that push the boundaries of autonomous AI capabilities. My work focuses on creating institutional-grade evaluation systems, security frameworks, and prompt optimization methodologies through independent research and hands-on experimentation.

## 🎯 Core Expertise

- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Advanced prompt design, optimization, and meta-analysis techniques *(self-taught)*
- **NIST AI Frameworks**: AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) implementation and compliance *(self-directed study)*
- **AI Governance**: Comprehensive frameworks including Paul-Elder Critical Thinking, ISO 42001, IIA AI Auditing *(independent research)*
- **Security Systems**: CyberShield Defense Framework (CSDF) development *(self-developed)*
- **Framework Architecture**: Multi-agent systems, recursive evaluation, and benchmarking methodologies *(self-taught)*
