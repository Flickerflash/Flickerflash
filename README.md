# Hi, I'm Ndr (Flickerflash) 👋

## About Me
Self-taught, self-directed **Pioneer** of AI Orchestration Engineering, AI Prompt Engineering and MCP–Autonomous AI Prompt Engineering portfolio creator.

I design advanced AI frameworks and governance systems under the Agent Lavender lens and Gold Star audit standard. My focus is on institutional-grade evaluation systems, security frameworks, and prompt optimization methodologies built through independent research and hands-on experimentation.

## 🎯 Core Expertise

- **AI Prompt Engineering**  
  Advanced prompt design, optimization, and meta-analysis techniques *(self-taught)*  

- **NIST AI Frameworks**  
  AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) implementation and compliance *(self-directed study)*  

- **AI Governance**  
  Paul–Elder Critical Thinking, ISO 42001, and IIA AI Auditing–aligned governance structures *(independent research)*  

- **Security Systems**  
  CyberShield Defense Framework (CSDF) for AI security and defense *(self-developed)*  

- **Framework Architecture**  
  Multi-agent systems, recursive evaluation, and benchmarking methodologies *(self-taught)*
